### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is RaphaÃ«l Maurice Forment, I am a musician/live-coder from France (Lyon). I build musical systems for improvisation. I am a mostly auto-didact programmer. I am happy to deep-dive into code when I need to and I love programming as a craft practice. I recently defended my PhD (musicology) at Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne. My work centers on the study of live coding practices. I play concerts, give workshops. I care about open source software.

- ðŸ”­ I have worked on [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr/) and [Topos](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/Topos/), two experimental live coding environments. Now at rest, waiting for the fly to bite me again. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub Issues or e-mail (easy to find)

**Note:** I have moved most of my current work on a private Git repo. Ping me to learn more.
