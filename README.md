### Hi 👋

My name is Raphaël Maurice Forment, I am a musician and live-coder from France (Lyon / Paris). I am mostly working in the field of computer music, building systems for musical improvisation. I am dedicated to use my computer as a creative / expressive musical instrument like any other 🐡. Even though I am not a natural born programmer, I am willing to deep-dive when needed and I love programming as a craft practice. I am currently doing my PhD at the Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne, working on live coding.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr/), a live coding environment for Python.
- 🌱 Learning more about Python, packaging, Rust, building robust software, etc.
