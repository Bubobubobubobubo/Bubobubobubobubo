### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is RaphaÃ«l Maurice Forment, I am a musician and live-coder from France (Lyon / Paris). I build musical systems for improvisation. I am not a natural born programmer (mostly auto-didact) but I am happy to deep-dive when I need to and I love programming as a craft practice. I am currently doing my PhD at the Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne. My work is centered around live coding practices. I play concerts, I give workshops, I try to articulate programming with my artistic practice as much as possible.

- ðŸ”­ I have worked on [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr/) and [Topos](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/Topos/), two live coding environments. Now on maintenance mode only until my PhD is done.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub Issues or e-mail (easy to find)
