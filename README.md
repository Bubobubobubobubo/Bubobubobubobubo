### Hi 👋

My name is Raphaël Maurice Forment, I am a musician and live-coder from France (Lyon / Paris). I build systems for musical improvisation. I am not a natural born programmer but I am willing to deep-dive when I need to and I love programming as a craft practice. I am currently doing my PhD at the Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne working on live coding. I play concerts, I give workshops, I try to articulate code with artistic practice as much as possible.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr/) and [Topos](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/Topos/), two live coding environments.
- 🌱 Learning more about Python, packaging and building robust software, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub Issues or e-mail (easy to find)
