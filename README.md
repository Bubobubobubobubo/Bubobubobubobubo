### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is RaphaÃ«l Maurice Forment, I am a musician/live-coder from France (Lyon). I build musical systems for improvisation.
I am not a natural born programmer -- mostly auto-didact -- but I am happy to deep-dive when I need to and I love programming as a craft practice.
I recently defended my PhD (musicology) at Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne. My work is usually centered around live coding practices.
I play gigs, I give workshops, I try to articulate programming with my artistic practice as much as possible. I care about open source software.

- ðŸ”­ I have worked on [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr/) and [Topos](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/Topos/), two live coding environments. Now at rest, waiting for the fly to bite me again. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub Issues or e-mail (easy to find)
